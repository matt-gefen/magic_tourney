# Magic Tourney

Deployed Game: https://magic-tourney.netlify.app/

## Hello Spellcaster!
You have entered into Magic Tourney, a competition that pits Wizard against Wizard in a turn-based battle!
In this game you will be able to select a character and challenge an NPC Boss for the crown!
Inspired by the classic turn-based battle systems of Old-School Final Fantasy, Pokemon, and Earthbound, each Tourney Match boils down to the following:

1. Select a move that you have enough AP (Action Points) to use</li>
2. Use the 'Next' button to observe your move's impact as well as the Boss' move</li>
3. Repeat until the 10th round or one of you has less than 1 HP (Hit Points)</li>

You'll be prompted to select a character from the following options:
### Mage - Balanced Strength

- Magic Missle: Deals 15 damage - Costs 0 AP
- Thunder Ward: Reduces impact of next attack by 100% - Costs 1 AP
- Enhance Ability: Increases Magic Missle damage by 5 - Costs 2 AP
- Meteor: Deals 35 damage- Costs 4 AP

As of now, the game consists of one Boss character NPC, Mitch The Litch. His moveset and action options mirror the Mage (with a stronger, single-use Ultimate)
